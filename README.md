# Parallel Lanczos Algorithm for PCA

For my AMSC 763: Advanced Numerical Linear Algebra (https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/elman/763.21/syl.html) final project, I am diving into the Lanczos algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm) further. Specifically, I am implementing a serial and parallel version of the Lanczos method which will be used to approximate the SVD of a data matrix $'X'$. The goal, is to use this approximated SVD to perform PCA on the data matrix for data visualization. Hopefully, using the Lanczos algorithm to construct the first two to three columns of $'U,V'$, from the SVD: $'X = UDV^T'$, will be a more efficient yet still accurate approah to computing the PCA of X.
